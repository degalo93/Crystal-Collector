# Crystal-Collector

This is my twist on the Crystal collector game.

In this game the player is given a random number and there are 4 objects you will click on to add a specific amount of points to the total score. In order to win the game your score will need to equal the score of the random number.

The value of each objects is hidden until you click it. Each time the game start the value of each crystal will change again.
